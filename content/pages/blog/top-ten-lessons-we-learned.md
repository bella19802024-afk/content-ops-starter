**About the Author:**
*Infinity Pyaar is a seeker of truth, a messenger of Light, and a storyteller of the soul. Her words are born from lived battles between illusion and awakening, and from the eternal faith that love is stronger than darkness. Through her writing, she bridges the intimate and the divine, turning pain into wisdom and trials into letters of light. Light Letters is not only her first novel, but also a testimony of her mission: to remind humanity that no force is greater than God’s love, and that every soul carries a sacred purpose. She writes for the twin flames, for the dreamers, for the wounded, for the healers — for all who dare to believe that destiny is made of light.*
